# AWS Step Functions Practice

This repository is a test repository I have used to implement and understand AWS Step Functions.

It will include two basic lambdas, which will be linked together using AWS Step Functions.

Over time I will build on these functions with testing to be a more thoughful example of orchestration, rather than two random functions.

The State Machine will be implemented via terraform
